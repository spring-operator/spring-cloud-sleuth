/**
 * Well-known {@link org.springframework.cloud.sleuth.Span#tag(String, String) span tag}
 * keys.
 *
 * <h3>Overhead of adding Trace Data</h3>
 *
 * Overhead is directly related to the size of trace data exported out of process.
 * Accordingly, it is better to tag what's important for latency troubleshooting, i.e. a
 * whitelist vs. collecting everything and filtering downstream. The keys listed here are
 * very common in tracing tools, and are considerate to the issue of overhead.
 *
 * <p>
 * When evaluating new keys, consider how much additional data it implies, and if that
 * data is critical to classifying, filtering or displaying traces. More data often means
 * larger systems, less retention, or a lower sample rate.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, in zipkin, a thrift-encoded span with an "sr" annotation is 82 bytes plus
 * the size of its name and associated service. The maximum size of an HTTP cookie is 4096
 * bytes, roughly 50x that. Even if compression helps, if you aren't analyzing based on
 * cookies, storing them displaces resources that could be used for more traces.
 * Meanwhile, you have another system storing private data! The takeaway isn't never store
 * cookies, as there are valid cases for this. The takeaway is to be conscious about
 * what's you are storing.
 *
